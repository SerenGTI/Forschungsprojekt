Gemini\cite{Gemini} is a framework for parallel graph processing. In comparrison to the other NUMA-aware frameworks we discuss here Gemini does's not support shared memory parallel processing, it is completely message based using MPI. It seems to be very lightweight and has only the very basically needed functionallity implemented, which leeds to clear source code and small binarys. A basic API hides data and computation distribution details from the user writing applications. It comes with five algorithms already implemented included the three we are testing in this paper. While setting it up and even while benchmarking we had various problems with bugs in the source code, like non zero terminated strings and missing return statements. While debugging we forked the origional repository and made our changes there. DODO link repository.
