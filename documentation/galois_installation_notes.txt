Dependencies:
    C++ compiler (has to be C++-17 compliant(gcc >= 7, clang >= 7))
    cmake >= 3.13
    Boost library >= 1.58.0 (full install recommended)
    LLVM >= 7.0 (with RTTI support)
Optional dependencies:
    Linux HUGE_PAGES support (2MB pagesize (ideally allocation of huge pages on kernel boot (hugepages=<num_of_pages>), if multiple huge page sizes are supported a selection (hugepagesz=<size>) should be made pre allocation))
        If the mmap system call is used to allocate huge pages, a pseudo filesystem of type hugelbfs has to be mounted (for further information "https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt")
    libnuma support
    MPICH2 for distributed systems
    CUDA for distributed heterogenous systems
